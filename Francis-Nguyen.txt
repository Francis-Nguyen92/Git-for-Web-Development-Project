Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        block starts on new line inline does not. Block takes the full width left to right, inline takes up as much width as necessary.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        it no longer exists in the normal document layout flow. Instead it sits on its own layer separate from everything else. Usefule to create isolated features that don;t intefere with the layout of other elements.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        Give the element a percentage width or use auto.
    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        block:<address><div><footer> inline:<span><img> inline-block:<button>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
        The box model is a series of boxes around an html element consisting of margin, border, and padding. The fix is box-sizing: border-box that results in 20px padding and 5px borders to results in 100px by 100px
